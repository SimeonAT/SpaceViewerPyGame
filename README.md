# **SPACE VIEWER VIDEO GAME**

# **TO-DO LIST**

*	Write up a DESIGN PDF to plan out exactly how you want this game to function. Keep the game short and simple, and 
	avoid being too ambitious. 
*	Format the code for each Python file so that it is easy to read and make changes.
*	[The next steps of the program will be decided after the DESIGN PDF is written.]
