# **SPACE VIEWER VIDEO GAME**

This is a space sci-fi themed video game that I worked on in my free time. and is my first 
ever proramming hobby/passion project. Although I'm proud of the progress I made in this game,
there are still a few features that are still unfinished. At this point, I feel it is best
for me to work on other projects in order to improve my programming skills, and when I feel
inspired and I have extra time, I might spend some time making improvements on this game.

I made this game in Python through the use of the PyGame library. The sprites that I used, along
with the resources that I used to learn the skills I need to develop this game, are cited in the
"Art Citations" and "Programming Citations" sections below.

# **How to Play**

## **Installation**

1. Download the newest version of Python ([link](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "download link"),
   along with the most recent version of the [link](https://www.pygame.org/news "Pygame") library.

2. Download or clone this directory. Once downloaded, go to the folder and run in your terminal:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

## **Controls**

Arrow keys: Moves to the tile directly up, down, left, or right from the current tile, depending
			on the key that was pressed.

"A" and "D" keys: The "A" key moves the arrow left when at a textbox that gives you two choices.
				  The "D" moves this arrow to the right. The "A" and "D" keys are only used
				  when there is a textbox that offers you two possible choices.

"ENTER" key: Moves to the next textbox.
