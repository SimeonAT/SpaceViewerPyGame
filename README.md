# **SPACE VIEWER VIDEO GAME**

This is a space sci-fi themed video game that I worked on in my free time. and is my first 
ever proramming hobby/passion project. Although I'm proud of the progress I made in this game,
there are still a few features that are still unfinished. At this point, I feel it is best
for me to work on other projects in order to improve my programming skills, and when I feel
inspired and I have extra time, I might spend some time making improvements on this game.

I made this game in Python through the use of the PyGame library. The sprites that I used, along
with the resources that I used to learn the skills I need to develop this game, are cited in the
"Art Citations" and "Programming Citations" sections below.
