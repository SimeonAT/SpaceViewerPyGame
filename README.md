# **SPACE VIEWER VIDEO GAME**

# **TO-DO LIST**

*	~~Write up a DESIGN PDF to plan out exactly how you want this game to function. Keep the game short and simple, and 
	avoid being too ambitious.~~
*	Format the code for each Python file so that it is easy to read and make changes.
*	Change the textbox descriptions for the planets, objects, and spaceship sprites to what I wrote in the DESIGN.pdf. 
*	Create a Choice Textbox Tree ADT which will help organize the choices that the player can make when they choose YES/NO 
	in a given choice textbox. 
*	Implement the resource gathering mechanics.
*	Implement the combat mechanics.
