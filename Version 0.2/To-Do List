PHASE 0: PREPARATIONS
- Add all sprites you want to add into game
- MAKE CODE PORTABLE! Make sure code doesn't get into any errors regardless if it's being run on Unix or Windows.

PHASE 1: THE SIMULATION ELEMENTS
- Spend some time learning the basics of Simpy and
  see if it can help you make the simulation for the game
- Each planet and space object has an individual state/status:
    - Containing advanced civilizations
        - Small spaceship sprites fly around planet if planet has this state
    - No life / Has life
    - Inhabitable / Uninhabitable
    - Destroyed
        - No planet sprite; just asteroid rocks flying around where planet was
  that changes over time
- Advanced civilizations from other planets interact with each other
  - Ships fly to and from each other
  - Ships fight each other in wars
- Random and multiple descriptions and information for each space object

PHASE 2: TURN BASED VIDEO GAME ELEMENTS
- Add basic interactivity to space objects
  - You can enter a black hole, which will teleport you to a random galaxy
  - MULTIPLE TEXT BOXES
    - Basic space objects interactions: "talk" / "interact" feature for each object
- TURNED BASED BATTLES
  - [To Be Determined]
